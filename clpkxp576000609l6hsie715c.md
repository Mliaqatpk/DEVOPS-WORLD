**Pyhton Data Types:**  
  
\- Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.  
\- Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.  
\- Python has the following data types built-in by default: Numeric(Integer, complex, float), Sequential(string,lists, tuples), Boolean, Set, Dictionaries, etc  
**  
âœ” Python Data Structures:**  
  
Data structures are essential for efficient data organization in programming. Python simplifies learning these fundamentals compared to other languages.

1. **List:**
    
    * Lists are ordered and mutable, meaning you can change their elements after creation.
        
    * Elements in a list are enclosed in square brackets `[]`.
        
    * Lists allow duplicate elements.
        
    * Example:
        
        ```plaintext
         codemy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        ```
        
2. **Tuple:**
    
    * Tuples are ordered and immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.
        
    * Elements in a tuple are enclosed in parentheses `()`.
        
    * Tuples allow duplicate elements.
        
    * Example:
        
        ```plaintext
         codemy_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
        ```
        
3. **Set:**
    
    * Sets are unordered and mutable, meaning you can change their elements after creation.
        
    * Elements in a set are enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
        
    * Sets do not allow duplicate elements.
        
    * Example:
        
        ```plaintext
         codemy_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
        ```
        

Now, if you want to see how to create and use these data structures in Python, you can try running the following code in a Python environment:

```plaintext
# List
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("List:", my_list)

# Tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print("Tuple:", my_tuple)

# Set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print("Set:", my_set)
```
