            Before testing, make sure you understand the rules and policies you've configured in your AWS WAF WebACL. This includes rules for blocking or allowing specific types of requests based on conditions like IP addresses, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other common web vulnerabilities.
            
            #### Step 2: Use WAF Sample Web Requests
            
            AWS provides a set of [sample web requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-working-samples.html) that you can use to test your AWS WAF setup. These requests are designed to simulate various types of malicious activities.
            
            #### Step 3: Send Requests with AWS CLI or SDKs
            
            You can use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or one of the AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs) to send requests to your web application and observe how AWS WAF reacts. For example, you can use the `aws` CLI to send HTTP requests to an API Gateway protected by AWS WAF.
            
            ```plaintext
            bashCopy code# Example AWS CLI command to send an HTTP request
            aws apigateway test-invoke-method --rest-api-id YOUR_API_ID --resource-id YOUR_RESOURCE_ID --http-method GET
            ```
            
            #### Step 4: Monitor AWS WAF Logs
